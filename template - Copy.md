Explanation: While Beijing does offer a diverse job market and cultural richness, Chengdu's quality of life, leisure activities, and growing job market should not be underestimated. Chengdu has been ranked as China's happiest city for 14 years, indicating a high level of satisfaction among its residents (source: OQ). The city has also experienced significant growth in its economy, with a 40.9% increase in international trains operation and a 57.7% increase in China-Europe railway trains during the first half of the year (source: Xinhua). This growth is a testament to Chengdu's focus on high-end, intelligent, and green transformation of the manufacturing industry, promoting high-quality development.

Disposable income per capita in Chengdu has increased by 110% compared to 2012, with an average annual growth rate of 8.6% (source: OQ). This growth in income, combined with the lower cost of living, allows residents to enjoy a higher quality of life and more leisure activities. Chengdu's unique work-life balance, charm, and ability to support entrepreneurial pursuits and provide ongoing learning opportunities make it an attractive alternative to Beijing for those who value a more relaxed lifestyle and a growing job market.</div>
